### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")


```

_Write your comments about image 1 below_
the bars have no axes, so you cannot guarantee that the area of the box is actually proportional 

the comma is a decimal point?? misleading 

the people are weird and unnecessary
the pictures of speech bubbles in the bars can be misleading
what is the definition of spoken language? speaks every day? can speak? first language?
there is no use of colours 

## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 2 below_

not clear what colours, area and radius actually represents 


## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Write your comments about image 3 below_

cannot read the text since its too small
no title explaining what is going on 
no key to show what the colours mean, what the size of the circles mean


## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Write your comments about image 4 below_

the areas could be transparent so you can see the full area of the data clearer - opacity obstructs some of the data 
a key might be more effective than writing it in the limited space 



# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?

wide format data has more columns and less rows, whereas long format data has more rows and less columns 

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?

wide

How many observations are there in the data set?

5


## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1975","1989","1993","1995","1999","2001","2003","2005","2007","2009","2011"), 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 3 here

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 4 here
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()
```
theres only one observation for each point

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```


```{r working-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 5 here

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()

```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 6 here

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +

  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Percentage of Staff",
    title = "Proportion of Faculty Types",
    subtitle = "(1975-2011)") +
    geom_line() 
   


```

* Idea 2
* Idea 3

## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here
